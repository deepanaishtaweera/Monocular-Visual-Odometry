 02-\/02 Bundle adjustment has bug, I have to fix all points in order to get good result (and it indeed is better result compared to not using BA). Is the bug due to following reasons\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Is there a camera pose with 0 connection to the map point? ~\newline
 No.
\item Is the graph all connected, or piece wise connected? ~\newline
 No. In my test cases, all are connected.
\item Wrong information matrix? ~\newline
 No. I\textquotesingle{}ve tested \mbox{[}x, 0; 0, 1\mbox{]}, with x=1e-\/5 and 1e5. However, both are wrong.
